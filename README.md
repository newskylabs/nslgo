I am currently reading the book
["Deep Learning and the Game of Go"](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-and-the-game-of-go)
by 
[Max Pumperla](https://maxpumperla.com/) and 
[Kevin Ferguson](https://github.com/macfergus) - 
and this repository is for doing my "homework" :)

See also the github repository of the book:
