# nslgo - Entertaining myself with Go and Deep Learning...

I am currently reading the book
["Deep Learning and the Game of Go"](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-and-the-game-of-go)
by Max Pumperla and Kevin Ferguson - and this repository is for doing my "homework" :)

See also the github repository of the book:
